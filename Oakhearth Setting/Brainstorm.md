Protectorate: A protectorate is a state that maintains its internal autonomy but cedes control over certain areas, such as foreign affairs and defense, to a more powerful state. This arrangement often arises from treaties or historical relationships. For example, Bhutan was a protectorate of British India and later had a similar relationship with independent India, wherein India managed Bhutan's foreign relations and defense

The internals of the mountains in Wilhiem are largely controlled by semi-independent dwarven Holds (city-states) but they are Protectorate states to to Wilhiem. There are many Holds that are below ground, and those tend to have more old-fashioned beliefs



Whenever a person comes out of the closet they'll get a knock at the door and recieve a little gift bag with a rainbow pin and sex-ed pamphlet for their orientation. There are also snacks. If no door is available, one will appear. Research on this has yielded no results. It is believed to likely be a very powerful fey

Witches practice a magic between that of mages and druids. They take natural objects and manipulate the spirits to inbue them with magical properties. The majority of these items are one time use but in exchange for their limited use they are more powerful.


I think the world is double the size of earth to help justify the large predators.

I need to develop some prey animals that reproduce fast enough

**Ancient Forests:**
For some unknown reason, once a forest grows old enough it becomes innately magical. From what I've been able to determine the magic grows over time with it initially just attracting more powerful creatures and growing more rapidly. However, eventually the forest stops growing outwards and instead grows inwards. This causes the forests to be larger on the inside than on the outside with the oldest ones being rumor to be infinitely large. This allows for large creatures and plants to live in an area that seems much smaller. This intensity of this magical energy is a double edged sword, more useful magical creatures and plants appear abundantly, but so do those which are more dangerous. What's especially dangerous is that there is no barrier between the Ancient Forests and the rest of the world, so creatures will often wander out of them.

While they are called Ancient Forests, the name is an oversimplification. In reality any area with sufficiently strong nature magic can be an Ancient Forest. There are stories of fungal groves in mountains becoming Ancient Forests as well as accounts of jungles that are far more dense then they should be.
