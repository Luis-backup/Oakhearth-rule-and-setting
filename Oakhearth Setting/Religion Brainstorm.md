## Gaultism Creation Myth
#Gaultism 
It is said that in the beginning, there was nothing. Then, after timeless time, came Gault.

(Some older forms of Gaultism claim the first being was the Void itself, though it remains unclear whether "Void" refers to a primordial god or merely a personification of emptiness.)

In Their solitude, Gault grew lonely, and so They created Space. But Space alone was still and silent. Thus, Gault created Time, so that there might be a before and after. With Time in place, Space could begin to change. Yet Time and Space were too simple, too empty, and could not ease Gault’s loneliness. Seeking something more, Gault shaped the elemental spheres: Earth, Wind, Fire, and Water. From these spheres, Life emerged.

However, this life, though alive, was simple and unthinking. So Gault chose to bind the spheres together, overlapping them to created the Prime Sphere. In this new convergence, Life flourished. Still, it remained stagnant, even as Time moved forward. To break the stillness, Gault created Man, the flowing  of energy and intent. With Mana, Life found purpose, beauty, and endless variety. But in gaining the power to change, Life also gained the inevitability of Death.



Spirits: it's unclear what a spirit is but they are generally agreed not to be the same as a soul. It seems that spirits occur naturally and can possess or emerge from anything. Some scholars believe that Spirits are Mana given intent or emotiontion


Oakhearth Religion

Lesser Gods are allowed as long as they are not placed above The 4 main ones
\* lesser gods refered to as Vassels? Herlads? Emissaries?

They are called little gods and seen as servants to the greater gods


**Gaultism = Christianity 

The God equivalent is called Gault. The main Gaultism practiced in Wilhiem is often referred to Eastern Gaultism

The Sun god is sometimes referred to as Gaultvox and the Moon goddess Gaultmens (mens = mind in latin)

  
Belief in Gault seems to originate from the country to the west where Wilhelm was born

  
  

The dwarves of Wilhiem follow a specific sect of Gaultism, except that they do not have worship for the celestial bodies (since they mostly live underground). It is called Earthen Gaultism. The aspects worshiped are called:

- Gaultstone: represents having a good foundation
	- Includes things like familial bonds, education
- Gaultiron: represents skill and work
	- Love of work and development of skills
- Gaultgem: represents beauty and pride
	- Includes self-worth, hygiene, pride of your work
    

Some older and more secluded communities of Dwarves still practice an older religion which does resemble Earthen Gaultism, but the three aspects were individual gods and lacked Gault


The people still believe in the primordial five (Time, Material, Life, Death, and Mana)  but they understand them as being like Elementals, absent of thought, and that Celst is the one that combined them to create the world. 


The four gods of Wilhiem are understood to be different aspects of Celst, so you would essentially pray to the part of them that has that domain. They are referred to as the Celestials. The four gods are metaphorically a family, where each one represents an idealized member of a traditional family. 

- Even though it is a single religion, there are sects that place more importance on some Celestials. The largest sect is the Sonnaris sect
