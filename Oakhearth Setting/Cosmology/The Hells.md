## What are the Hells
Though the origin and purpose of the Hells remain subjects of intense theological debate, at its simplest they are the source of Demons and Devils. In #Gaultism , it is said that the Hells are the shadow of Sonnaris's glory, and that the evils of the world fled to this shadow to hide from his judgment. The term "Hells" (plural) reflects their fragmented nature because it is not a single piece mass but many pieces. Most scholars agree these fragments are organized by the evils they embody, though the exact number remains hotly contested. However, the most common number stated is seven to represent the core sins of humanity. The structure of the Hells is equally debated, with interpretations varying, including (but not limited to): boundless islands separated by a void-sea, a series of spheres orbiting a black sun, and like multiple infinitely large disks stack above one another based on the strength of the sin they represent. 

## Demons
Demons are manifestations of the sins of mortals. It is believed that it take multiple of the same sin to create a demon as they would have otherwise overwhelmed the other spheres. However, some theorize that a sufficiently great sin can create a singular demon. Many believe that these are the source of archdemons, noticeably more powerful and intelligent demons. Because of the nature of their creation, demons generally seem to be incapable of changing in any significant manner, leading them to be rather predictable.


## Devils
Devils form from the souls of evil mortals. While most devils are barely larger than a rat (and just as strong), it is believed that the greater the sins of a mortal, the greater the devil the become when they are reborn as a devil. However, from conversations with summoned devils, it seems that devils loose the majority of their memories when reborn. They understand why they were sent to the Hells, but much of the context is foggy. However, it is very possible the devils lied as their true names are said to have power over them. 

Unlike demons, devils are capable of changing. They do this by amassing souls. Weaker devils are said to do this by literally consuming other devils. However, stronger devils rely on making deals, either with other devils or mortals. The devils with the most power are called Devil Lords

### Punishment
While demons are natural inhabitants of the Hells, it is generally believed that devils are cast into the Hells as punishment. For this reason it is said that living living in the Hells is painful for devils, even if they try to hide. The air scratches their throats, food provides no nourishment, and sleep never comes.
