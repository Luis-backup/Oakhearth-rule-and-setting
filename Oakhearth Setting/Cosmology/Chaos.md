#chaos
I don't know if I will actually publish this aspect of my notes, but I will keep them for the sake of my own information at least. 

The Chaos as the name implies is chaotic. No one can agree if it is it's own sphere or if maybe it is the in-between of the spheres somehow or maybe it is some ancient god. The only people I have been able to get any information about Chaos from have been cultists or mad men. 

From what I can gather, most people who have any knowledge of Chaos seem to believe that it actually predates the gods. Some of those who believe in The Void, even believe that Chaos existed before it. Others say that the Chaos actually comes from some distant future and that Chaos as stretched back in time somehow.

## Cults
While I have been able to find out about very few cults that worship Chaos, it does seem to be a common denominator of many cults. One notable example comes from the Cult of the Emerald City which believe that you somehow must get past Chaos (unclear if it acts as a guardian or some physical barrier) to see the truth and enter the Emerald City.
