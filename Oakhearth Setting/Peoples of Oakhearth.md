**Note**: In the common tongue, the terms "man" and "humanity" refer to all of the sentient peoples of Tierra. Furthermore, these notes only include the most common peoples.

There hundreds if not thousands of version of the stories of the origin of man, but for the sake of simplicity, I shall only recount the version most commonly told in #Gaultism . 

It is said that after Gault created the universe and all its spheres, They wished to create beings to love and to share Their creation with. So, They created the first souls. Then, They drew upon aspects of the elements to give them form: from the earth, Gault gave them bodies; from the water, Gault gave them blood; from the air, Gault gave them breath; and from fire, Gault gave them warmth.

The name of these first peoples has since been forgotten, so we now call them the Precursors. The Precursors were curious and adaptable, so Gault split Themself into Their greater aspects (Sonnaris, Mondra, Steigen, and Niedren) to teach, protect, and love the Precursors.

For a time, there was peace reigned. Gault, content in Their creation, withdrew; granting the Precursors freedom to choose their own path and the will to shape their own destiny. But in the wake Gault's absence, danger emerged.

From the convergence of the material and the elemental spheres came beings wrought from raw elemental fury and power, yet untouched by the love of Gault. In the absence of love , hatred took root. These creatures turned their wrath upon the Precursors. They were the Giants, born of earth, and the Dragons, brooded of fire, water, and air.

Faced with the threat of extinction, the Precursors were forced to adapt, giving rise to the races of Tierra. 

## Common Ancestries
While commonly referred to as "races," the more accurate term is Ancestries, as all peoples trace their lineage back to the Precursors. Therefore, to maintain clarity and precision, I will use the term Ancestries moving forward.

### Elves
The Elves are descendant of those who fled into the woods. They are naturally adapted to living in the woods with their skin tones typically matching the color the tree bark in the area they are born. While not common, many Elves even have the ability to temporally change the color and texture of their bodies to better camouflage. Because of this connection to nature Elvish culture is very protective of the natural world which has led to some conflict. 

Physically, Elves are typically lean compared to humans with them seeming to develop less body fat overall. Because this is seen in Elves that are not as active such as those in that have chosen to live in the cities, it seems like a biological aspect rather than something from behavior. A side affect of this is that many Elves appear androgynous to other peoples. Their ears tend to be slightly smaller than that of humans but are noticeably longer and pointed. In terms of hair, most of them have shades of brown, but there are many Elves who have hair the color of foliage of the area they live in with the more vibrant colors being less common (culturally equivalent of blonde and red-head respectively.). Dark green is the 2nd most common after brown hair. 

Elves stand at a similar height to humans with most standing between 5 and 6 feet tall. Culturally, 

- descendant from those who fled to the wild parts of the world
- deeper connection to nature

### Dwarves
- descendant from those who fled to below ground

### Orcs
- descendant from those who chose a nomadic lifestyle
- Large flat ears

### Lightfoots
- descendant from those who learned to hide in all the small space

### Humans
- humans aren't naturally the best at anything, but they serve as a jack of all trades letting them be more flexible in times of crisis


## Uncommon Ancestries
These Ancestries emerged later than the more common ones and are often the result of exposure to energies beyond the Prime Sphere. From what I can gather, they are carried through bloodlines, meaning generations may pass without one appearing in a family. However, accounts I've collected suggest that some individuals develop into these Ancestries after intense or prolonged exposure to certain types of magic. Whether this transformation is entirely new or merely awakens dormant traits already present in a person's bloodline (or perhaps even their soul) remains unclear.

Unfortunately, due to their association with typically antagonistic forces, people with this ancestry will often face greater stigma.

### Seraphsent
- connected to Celestials

### Jotunnheir
- Connected to Giant (who call themselves the JÃ¶tunn)

### Dragonborne
- connected to dragons and the elements

### Hellkin
- connected to the Hells


## Animal-Folk
\* not playable 

### Miauen
- intelligent cats that can comfortably walk on two legs. Are also strong than common house cats
- The more athletically inclinded actually tend to become hunters with the best of them hunting goblins

### Hasen
The Hasen are intelligent lagomorphs (general terms for rabbits and hares). They are to rabbits as humans are two apes. Standing upright on their hind legs, an average Hasen measures between two and three feet tall, though they often sit back on their haunches, making them appear smaller. They common in a variety of colors and patterns with most of them being earthy colored or spotted. However, Hasen are known to be of any color, though more extreme colors are rare. 

Most Hasen are farmers, and for good reason; their presence naturally enhances crop growth. According to legend, the first Hasen was a gift from Sonnaris  (the god of the sun) to his wife Mondra (the goddess of the moon) after her favorite rabbit was eaten by a wolf. With the vitality of the sun and the tranquility of the moon flowing through them, Hasen seem to carry a quiet blessing that helps crops flourish.

Historically, the Hasen were enslaved, by whatever the dominate group was. However, multiple revolts throughout the known world has forced the majority of governing bodies to recognize their personhood. In Wilhiem, Hasen that act as farmers are not taxed and largely independent as long as they given the government priority in buying crops. Because of this there are many small independent Hasen farms throughout the country. In many cases, especially around large cities, the local government own the farms but hire Hasen seasonally. This has caused some conflict with Human farmers because of the difference in pay, but the overall benefit has led decently stable peace.
