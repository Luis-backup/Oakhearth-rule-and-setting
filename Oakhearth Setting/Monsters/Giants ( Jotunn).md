## Origins of Giants
While they refer to themselves as Jotunn most people know them as Giants. It is said that the Giants were born when spirits from the Prime Sphere bled into the Sphere of Earth. Because of their great size and strength, they though it was only natural for them to rule over all of the smaller beings, thus the attempted to conquer the world, leading them to fight the newly formed dragons. 

## General Appearance
Giants appear very similar to humans, leading some to believe that they were born from malicious mortal souls. As their names imply, giants are very large with the smallest type of giants standing at about 15 feet. In regards to sex, any connection reproductive organs or other such features seem to be purely for aesthetics, as giants have a great control over their physical appearance. As a result, their language lacks any gendered terms, but they are known to adopt them when speaking to other intelligent beings.

## Reproduction
Giants do not reproduce sexually, instead they create a `Minera`. The material of the `Minera` is dependent on the type of giant. When two or more giants decided to create a `Minera` they gather the highest quality version of their respective type and each member creating `Minera` infuses some aspect of their own soul/self into it. They then place this into the earth, and a few moments later, a new giant emerges as a fully grown adult.
