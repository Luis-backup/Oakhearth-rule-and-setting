The schools of magic refer to how spells are classified for the sake of study. However, the number, name, and function of the schools is hotly debated among scholars. Therefore, I have attempted to create a generalized set of schools which also more or less follows the those set forth by the Mage's guild in `Wilheim`.

## List of Schools
### Protection
As its name implies, this school of magic focuses on the protection of the user and those around them. You will most commonly see this school in the form of invisible or translucent magical barriers that protect against harm. It is also the school that encompasses spells that negate other spells or magical effects like "Dispel Magic"

### Conjuration
This school focuses on manipulating mana to give it a physical form for specific purpose. Because of the difficulty of creating physical material from energy, the majority of objects created this way are temporary. You will most commonly see this spell in the form of temporarily creating weapons or traps, allowing the user flexibility without carrying the extra weight. More advanced spells of this school allow users to manifest spirits or spectral creatures. It also includes the creation of magical gates for teleportation or summoning creatures from other spheres. 

### Illusion
This school of magic is often confused with conjuration, but it differs in that nothing is actually created. In some respects, this confusion is purposeful as it allows a less skilled magician to appear more powerful as they can seemingly conjure great creatures of objects. The illusion school of magic also encompasses effects that affect the mind. In its strongest forms, this type of magic allows the user to dominate the mind of another, but it can also affect the dreams of other creatures. While most magicians know some spells form this school, those who specialize in it are considered deeply untrustworthy. 

### Elemental
This school of magic focuses in the manipulation of the four elements: Earth, Water (including ice), Fire, and Air. Of these four elements, fire is the most commonly studied as it can be easily produced from mana and its versatility. In general, for the spells to function some amount of element must be present in the area, but not much of the element is required as the user can effectively amplify the mass of the material. This is most commonly seen in water-based spells as the user can draw water from the moisture in the air or convert ice to water. Because of this the strength of strength of Elemental spells can be affected by the environment. 

### Divination
Divination is the school of enhanced perception, allowing the user to peer into the past, present, and future. This school is largely utilitarian, allowing the user to identify objects, detect magic, and read the intentions of other creatures. The most infamous aspect of this school is perceiving the future. While incredibly useful, the future is fickle and ever in flux, causing many predictions to be incorrect which has led many to see future-focused practitioners as conmen. However, the most powerful Divination users learn to navigate their visions without becoming slaves to them.
 

### Life/Death
This is the school of manipulating the health of a creature. At the its most basic, those who focus on the Life aspect of this school learn to heal even the most grievous of wounds, while those who focus on the Death aspect can learn to kill with a single touch. However, this is only the surface level aspects. This school can even bring people back from dead, or failing that imbue corpses with a false life. 

### Transmutation
The Transmutation school of magic focus on the transformation of your environment and self. At it's most basic, this allows the user to change the shape and characteristics of the objects and creatures around you. Most commonly, this is used to temporarily enhance a creature or an object. However, more powerful spells allow for shape-shifting and creating artificial life. Notably, this school also allows for the manipulation of metal and the creation of lightning, things that many except to be elemental.  

### Telekinesis
This school focuses on the movement of creatures and objects. Practitioners can lift, push, pull, or restrain targets. At its simplest, Telekinesis allows for tasks like retrieving distant items or opening doors without physical contact. At its most powerful, it can hurl enemies through the air and destroy objects.


## Overlapping Spells
The actual difference between the schools are blurry, so the classification of spells under certain schools can be confusing. This confusion is further amplified by the fact that certain magicians will create versions of existing spells that fall under their specialization. For example, the spell `Hold Person` is traditionally a Telekinesis spell, but a common modification of the spell tricks the mind into believing it cannot move, placing it within the Illusion school of magic.
