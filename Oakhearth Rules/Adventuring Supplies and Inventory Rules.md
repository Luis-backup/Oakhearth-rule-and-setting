## Inventory Rules
Each player has 10 inventory slots. Most items occupy one slot. Some items, such as containers, can hold multiple smaller items within them. For example, a coin pouch can carry up to 500 coins but still only occupies a single inventory slot, regardless of its contents.

### Tracking Ammunition
Ammunition does not need to be tracked during gameplay. It is assumed that characters routinely purchase sufficient standard ammunition as part of their regular expenses. However, specialized or magical ammunition such as +1 arrows must be tracked individually. Additionally, carrying a quiver (or another appropriate container) is required and occupies one inventory slot.

## Adventuring Supplies
### Packs
It assumed that adventures are competent enough to plan ahead for their travels. To reflect this, the following rules are purposefully flexible.

Each Pack contains specific types of items. Every Pack starts with 5 charges. Whenever a player wants to retrieve an item from a Pack, they expend 1 charge. At that point, the item associated with that charge is defined and known (Schrödinger's cat). If the item is particularly large or expensive, the GM may rule that it costs more than 1 charge to define. To regain spent charges, the player must pay 1/5th of the Pack’s total cost per charge, and must be in a location where such items could reasonably be purchased.

### Generic Items
For the purpose of simplicity and time. For the rules and list of miscellaneous items default to the rules and costs of Dungeons & Dragons 5e

### Consumables
#### Potions
Potions take 1 AP to use. You can feed a potion to another creature for 2 AP, however you cannot do this if the other creature is within the melee attack range of an enemy creature. 

#### Healer's Kit
You cannot use a this item while in combat or any time where the characters are in a rush, such as running from a monster. 

The Healer's Kit has 5 charges. You can expend 1 charge at a time. When you expend a charge, make a DC10 Medicine check. Success: Target creature regains 1 HP. Success (each 5): The creature regains +1 HP.

You cannot regain more HP than equal to half of your max HP per 24 hour period.
