## Traversal
### Spaces and Distance
Movement and distance in Oakhearth are measured in Spaces, where each Space represents a 5-foot square on the grid.
* If a target is 5 Spaces away, they are 25 feet from you.  
* Diagonal movement costs the same as moving in a straight line (1 Space \= 5 feet).

### Difficult Terrain
Certain areas, such as thick foliage or muddy ground, are harder to move through. These areas are considered Difficult Terrain.
* When moving through Difficult Terrain, you are **Slowed**.  
* Every 1 Space moved costs 2 Spaces of movement.

### Moving Through an Occupied Space
In some situations, you may need to move through a space occupied by another creature. The following rules apply:

#### General Rules:
* You cannot end your movement in another creature’s space unless a specific ability allows it.

#### Moving Through an Allied Space:
* You can always move through an ally’s space, but it counts as Difficult Terrain.

#### Moving Through a Non-Allied Space:
Your ability to move through an enemy’s space depends on size differences. This requires 1 AP to do:
* If a creature is 2 size categories larger or smaller than you, you can move through their space automatically, but it counts as Difficult Terrain.
* If a creature is NOT 2 size categories larger or smaller than you, you must make a Contested Athletics or Acrobatics Check against the target.  
    * **Success**: You move through the space, treating it as Difficult Terrain.  
    * **Failure**: You cannot move through the space and lose any remaining movement from that Move Action.

## Stealth
Creatures that are Unseen or Unheard are more difficult to discover.

Unseen:
Creatures that can’t see you are Exposed (your Attacks against them have Advantage) and Hindered against you (they have Disadvantage on Attacks against you). You are Unseen by a creature while you are imperceivable to its visual senses, such as when you’re Fully Concealed, Invisible, or it’s Blinded.

Unheard:  
You are Unheard while you remain silent, talk no louder than a whisper, or are within an area affected by the Silence Spell or a similar effect.

Hidden:
You are Hidden from a creature while you’re both Unseen and Unheard by it. Your location is unknown to creatures you’re Hidden from.


## Damage Type Categories
Damage types are organized into categories, such as Physical, Elemental, and Mystical.
- Physical Damage:  Slashing, Piercing, and Bludgeoning damage.
- Elemental Damage: Cold, Corrosion, Fire, Lightning, and Poison.
- Mystical Damage: Radiant, Psychic, and Umbral.

## Managing Damage Multiples
**Multiple Damage Types**: When dealing bonus damage on an Attack Check or Spell Check deals more than 1 type of damage, you choose which of those damage types the bonus damage increases.

**Bonus Damage Against Multiple Targets**: If you add bonus damage to an Attack that targets multiple targets, the bonus damage only applies to one target of your choice. The Attack still benefits from Critical Hits, Heavy Hits, and beyond against each target. 

**Shared Damage**: When 2 or more creatures share damage, divide the total damage by the number of creatures (rounding up), and distribute the damage equally among the creatures.

## Jumping
There are two types of jumps: a Long Jump and a High Jump. A Long Jump represents the distance a creature can move while jumping horizontally, and a High jump represents the distance a creature’s feet can reach above the ground when jumping vertically.

### Jump Distance
A creature’s Jump Distance is equal to its Agility (minimum of 1).

**Running Jump**: After moving at least 2 Spaces, a creature can perform a Long Jump (horizontal jump) or a High Jump (vertical jump). If performing a Long Jump, it can jump its Jump Distance in Spaces. If performing a High Jump, it can jump its Jump Distance in feet (1ft = 30cm). 

**Standing Jump**: A creature can forgo moving at least 2 Spaces before performing a jump, however its maximum Jump Distance is halved for the jump.
- High Jump = Jump Distance (in Feet)
- Long Jump = Jump Distance (in Spaces)


## Falling
When a creature begins falling, it immediately falls up to 100 Spaces. 

**Falling Damage**: When a creature falls from a height more than its Agility in Spaces (minimum of 1 Space) and collides with the ground, an object, or a creature it takes True damage equal to the number of Spaces it fell (up to a maximum of 100 damage). 

**Reduced Impact**: A creature that’s going to take damage from Falling can make an Acrobatics Check to potentially reduce the Falling damage and avoid falling Prone. The DC equals 10 + 1 per each Space it falls. Success: It reduces the damage by an amount equal to its Agility (minimum of 0). Failure: It falls Prone.

### Uncontrolled Falling
If you are thrown off a ledge, knocked back from an explosion, unable to react, or restrained in some way, it is considered an Uncontrolled Fall (GM discretion). 

**Uncontrolled Impact**: If you are uncontrollably falling, the DC of Reduced Impact increases by 5. Additionally, you take damage when falling from any height (regardless of your Agility)

### Continuous Falling
If you are still falling at the end of your turn, you immediately fall another 100 Spaces.

### Falling While Flying
If you are knocked Prone while flying, you immediately fall up to 100 Spaces unless you are magically held aloft. If you are still falling at the start of your turn, you can spend 2 Spaces of movement to end the Prone Condition on yourself (as if standing up in mid air).

## Climbing
Creatures that lack a Climb Speed are Slowed while swimming. Depending on the conditions the GM may require an Athletics Check to continue moving. Creatures with a Climb Speed have advantage on these checks.
## Swimming
Creatures that lack a Swim Speed are Slowed while swimming. Depending on the conditions the GM may require an Athletics Check to continue moving. Creatures with a Swim Speed have advantage on these checks.

## Holding your Breath
Climbing Creatures that require air to breathe can hold their breath to avoid breathing in toxic air, drowning underwater, or suffocating in an airless vacuum. A creature that can no longer hold its breath begins **Suffocating**. The amount of time a creature can hold its breath depends on the type of stress they are exposed to and energy they’re exerting.

There are two types of measures to hold your breath: a Calm Hold and a Stressed Hold. A Calm Hold represents the duration a creature can hold its breath while in a low stress environment while doing little to no activity, and a Stressed Hold represents the time a creature can hold its breath while in a high stress environment while doing lots of activity.

### Breath Duration
- Calm Hold: a number of *minutes* equal to your Might attribute
- Stressed Hold: a number of *rounds* equal to your Might attribute

### Losing your Breath
- Speaking: Creatures that attempt to speak while holding their breath, such as to satisfy the Verbal Component required to cast a Spell, reduce their Breath Duration by 1. 
- Knocking the Wind Out: Whenever you take damage, you must make a Might Save. The DC equals 10 or twice the damage taken (whichever is higher). Failure: You lose 1 round of air

### Suffocating
At the start of each of your turns, you suffer the following effects while you’re Suffocating:
- Loss of Consciousness: You must make a DC 10 Might Save. Failure: You fall Unconscious. Success: You remain conscious, but the DC increases by 5.
- HP Reduction: You take an amount of True damage equal to 1/4 your Maximum HP. 

These effects can’t be reversed by any means until you regain the ability to breathe again.


## Vision
### Line of Sight
Line of Sight refers to a creature being able to see something within their field of view. On a grid map, this would mean that you can draw a straight line from any one corner of the Space that you’re on to any one corner of a Space that the other creature is on. If you can see a creature but they’re partially behind something (a wall, another creature, etc.), then they have Cover.

#### Cover
- 1/2 Cover: Creatures have a -2 penalty on Attack Checks and Spell Checks against a target’s AC while the target is behind 1/2 Cover.
- 3/4 Cover: Creatures have a -5 penalty on Attack Checks and Spell Checks against a target’s AC while the target is behind 3/4 Cover.
- Full Cover: Creatures can’t make Attack Checks or Spell Checks against a target’s AC while the target is behind Full Cover.

### Concealment 
- Partially Concealed: A creature is Partially Concealed while within an area of thin fog, moderate foliage, or Dim Light. Creatures have DIS on Awareness Checks made to see things that are Partially Concealed.
- Fully Concealed: A creature is Fully Concealed while in an area that blocks vision entirely, such as Darkness, thick fog, or dense foliage. Creatures are considered Blinded for the purposes of seeing things that are Fully Concealed.

### Illumination
There are three levels of illumination:
1. Bright Light: Fully illuminates everything within its area, allowing creatures to see normally. Most sources of mundane fire produces an area of Bright Light, such as torches, lanterns, or campfires.
2. Dim Light: Only partially illuminates an area, allowing creatures to see with difficulty. The area covered by a shadow, the light of a full moon, and the light produced by dusk and dawn are all examples of Dim Light.
	1. Seeing in Dim Light: Unless a creature has Darkvision or another means to see normally in Dim Light, they perceive things within Dim Light as Partially Concealed (DIS on Awareness Checks to see them).
3. Darkness: An area that lacks any form of illumination, making it impossible for creatures to see.
	1. Seeing in Darkness: Unless a creature has Darkvision or another means to see partially or normally in Darkness, they perceive things within Darkness as Fully Concealed (Blinded to see them). While in an area of Darkness, a creature can’t see anything within the area, but it can still see areas of Dim Light or Bright Light that are within its Line of Sight.

### Vision Types
**Darkvision**
Creatures with Darkvision have the ability see in Dim Light and Darkness out to a specified range. A creature with Darkvision can see areas of Dim Light within the specified range as if it were Bright Light, and see areas of Darkness within the specified range as if it were Dim Light. A creature can’t discern color using their Darkvision, only shades of grey.

**Tremorsense**
Creatures with Tremorsense can sense vibrations in the ground within a specified range, allowing them to automatically pinpoint the location of anything that is in contact with the same surface, including through Cover and Concealment. Creatures with Tremorsense and a Swim Speed can also pinpoint the location of creatures moving through water within the specified range

**Blindsight**
Creatures with Blindsight have the ability to see things within a specified range without the use of eyes. Creatures without eyes or that can see using echolocation are able to see things using Blindsight. A creature with Blindsight is immune to being Blinded, can see things that are Invisible, and can see unimpeded by Concealment. Blindsight doesn’t grant a creature the ability to see behind Cover.

**Truesight**
Creatures with Truesight have the ability to see things that are normally imperceptible out to a specified range. They can see through normal and magical Darkness, automatically see through illusions, and can perceive the true form of a Shapechanger or creature that is transformed by magic.
