## Overlapping Skills
In some situations, multiple skills may be applicable to the task at hand. When this occurs, you may use the skill with the highest modifier. However, the DC of the check may change depending on the skill you choose to use.

## Proficiency Level (PL)
Proficiency Level represents your proficiency with a Skill. There are several Proficiency Levels, ranging from Novice to Grandmaster. Each increasing Level of Proficiency Level grants greater bonuses to the Skill Checks in which you have Proficiency Levels. 

There are 5 Skill Proficiency Levels. You can spend Skill Points to increase your Proficiency Level in a given Skill, up to the maximum Skill Mastery Level of 5 (Grandmaster). Each Proficiency Level grants you a +2 bonus on the respective Skill Checks. The table below shows the bonuses granted by the different Proficiency Levels.

| Proficiency Level | Proficiency Bonus |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| 1 – Novice        | +2                |
| 2 – Adept         | +4                |
| 3 – Expert        | +6                |
| 4 – Master        | +8                |
| 5 – Grandmaster   | +10               |

### Proficiency Level Limits
You can spend Skill Points to gain Proficiency Levels, up to your Proficiency Level Limit.   Your Proficiency Level Limit starts at Novice and increases based on your Character Level as shown in the table below.  

| Character Level | Proficiency Level Limit |
| --------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1               | Novice                  |
| 5               | Adept                   |
| 10              | Expert                  |
| 15              | Master                  |
| 20              | Grandmaster             |

### Expertise
If your character has Expertise with a skill, they increase Proficiency Level Cap of a skill by 1. A skill can only benefit from one increase to its Proficiency Level Cap.

## Combat Proficiency
Combat Proficiency (CP) reflects your character's skill and experience in combat, including the effective use of weapons, armor, and other tools of war.

### Combat Proficiency Calculation
Your Combat Proficiency (CP) is calculated as: CP = 1 + ½ your character's level (rounded down with a min. of 1)

This represents the natural progression of your combat expertise as your character grows stronger and more experienced.

### Combat Training (CT)  
Combat Training reflects your character’s training with certain tools relevant to combat. If you lack Combat Training with a weapon, armor, or shield, you do not add your Combat Proficiency (CP) to rolls with that equipment. The following penalties apply when using equipment without CT:

- **Weapons:** When making an Attack Check with a weapon you lack CT in, you do not add your CP to the roll. You also do not get the benefit of the that weapon's Weapon Style
- **Shields:** Wielding a shield without CT in that type imposes Disadvantage on all Attack Checks and Spell Checks.
- **Armor:** Wearing armor without CT in that type reduces your AP by 2.

## Tool Proficiencies
When you level up, you can allocate Proficiency Levels to a Tool Proficiency, allowing you to improve your skill with specific tools. Each tool is associated with an Attribute that applies to rolls involving its use. If a Tool has more than one associated skill, you choose whichever is highest.

- Using a Tool Without Proficiency: If you have no PL in a tool, you only add the associated Attribute to the roll, and your capabilities with the tool may be limited.
- Using a Tool With Proficiency: If you have PL in a tool, you make a Tool Check, which functions like a skill check: Tool Check = d20 + Attribute + PL (up to your PL limit)
- Using a Tool Without the Proper Equipment: It is possible to attempt a Tool Check without the necessary tool, but this may impose limitations, increase the check’s difficulty, or extend the time required—subject to GM discretion.
	- Example: You might be able to craft a simple potion without a Brewing Kit, but it could take longer and have reduced effectiveness.
