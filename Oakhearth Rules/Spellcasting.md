In order to cast a Spell, you must know the Spell and spend the required amount of Resources (Action Points and Mana Points). The maximum number of Mana Points you can spend on a single Spell must be equal to or lower than your Mana Spend Limit.

## Spells Known
Spellcaster Classes know a number of Spells as shown in the Spells Known column of their Class Tables. The number of Spells they know increases with level to reflect their growing knowledge of magic as they gain experience. When a PC learns a news Spell, the spell must be included in their Spell List and possess any required Spell Tags. If a PC has access to multiple Spellcasting Features, they can learn new Spells by following the rules of either Feature.

### Wizard Spellbooks
Wizards can learn additional Spells beyond their Spells Known limit by using their Spellbook Feature. Spells they learn using their Spellbook feature don't count against the number of Spells Known. 


## Spell Components
The three spell components are Verbal, Physical, Material. Most spells use all three, but not all of them. If you lack any of the Spell Components, you cannot cast the spell, and no Mana is spent.
- Verbal: Requires you to be able to speak clearly at a normal speaking volume.
- Physical: Requires that you have at least one free-hand. Reflects the physical movements you use to manipulate mana and create sigils.
- Material: This is specified by each spell. If you have an Arcane Focus, you can ignore the material component if the cost of that component is less than 50 GP. 

## Spell Resources
Each Spell has a minimum number of Action Points (AP) that must be spent to cast the Spell. Many Spells also include a minimum number of Mana Points (MP) that must also be spent to cast the Spell. This is known as the Base Mana Cost of a Spell. 

**Action Points** 
All Spells require you to spend AP to cast them, with 2 AP as the standard cost for most Spells. Some Spells cost 1 AP (such as Cantrips) and usually have a lower base damage with modest effects. More powerful Spells have a higher AP cost (3 AP or higher) and deal greater damage or produce greater effects. These Spells may require a single Spellcaster to spend multiple turns to cast, or multiple Spellcasters working together.

### Mana Points
Each Spell has an MP cost that you must spend to cast it. There are different ways to spend additional MP on Spells, and the MP is spent when the Spell goes off successfully.

You Regain all of your Mana Points when you complete a Long Rest

### Spellcasting without Mana Points
Certain Spells can be cast without spending MP. These Spells include special Spell Tags, such as the Cantrip and Ritual Spell Tags. 

**Cantrips** 
Spells with the Cantrip Spell Tag don’t have an MP cost, but can be empowered with MP to enhance their damage or effects. 

**Rituals**
By performing a 10 minute ritual immediately before casting a Spell with the Ritual Spell Tag, the Spell can be cast without spending MP even if it normally has an MP cost.

## Spell Enhancements
Spell Enhancements allow a Spellcaster to increase the potency of their Spells by spending additional MP on the Spell (or AP for Cantrips). Spell Enhancements are specific to each Spell and are included in a Spell’s description. Many Spell Enhancements increase a Spell’s damage (if applicable), its duration, its range, its number of targets, or its Area of Effect (if applicable).

**Performing a Spell Enhancement**:
When you cast a Spell, you can spend additional AP or MP (stated in the Spell’s description) to perform a Spell Enhancement with your Spell. If the Spell requires a Spell Check, you must choose to do so before you make the Check. 

You can perform the same Spell Enhancement multiple times per Spell, unless it’s stated otherwise.

## Mana Spend Limit
You can spend a maximum number of Mana Points to cast a Spell equal to your Combat Proficiency. This limitation includes MP spent on Spell Enhancements and other Features that require MP. This is called your Mana Spend Limit.

**Example**: 
A level 6 Sorcerer (Combat Proficiency of 3) can spend up to 3 MP on any Spell they cast. They could cast a Spell with a base cost of 3 MP, or they could cast a Spell with a base cost of 2 MP and spend 1 MP on Spell Enhancements. Alternatively, they could cast a Spell without an MP cost, such as a Cantrip, and spend 3 MP on Spell Enhancements.

## MP Effects
These are abilities and effects (usually coming from Class Features) that cost MP and are very similar to what types of effects a Spell could cause. You can use an MP Effect in place of a Spell for the purposes of a Spell Duel or Combo Spellcasting.


## Combo Spellcasting
If you and 1 or more creatures know the same Spell, you can join your resources together to cast the Spell as a team. This is called Combo Spellcasting.

Remember that MP Effects count as Spells for the purposes of Spell Duels and Combo Spellcasting.

**Requirements**
You must meet the following requirements to participate in a Combo Spell:
- You know the Spell.
- You have enough AP to cast and spend on the Spell.
- You’re within 5 Spaces of at least 1 other participant.
- Each participant must act at the same time. This is typically done via Held Actions

**Primary Caster**: Everyone participating in the Combo Spellcasting must agree on which of them will be the Primary Caster. They will act as the Spell’s Point of Origin. 

**Contributing Mana**: Each participants can contribute an amount of MP between 1 and their Mana Spend Limit toward the casting of the Spell. The total mana spent must be equal to or higher than the base MP cost of the Spell. The total MP spent on the Spell has no limit as long as participants do not exceed their own Mana Spend Limits.

**Example**: 2 creatures have a Mana Spend Limit of 4 each. By performing a Combo Spellcasting, they can combine their MP together, up to 4 MP each for a total of 8 MP spent to cast a Spell. By working together, they can produce a much more powerful version of a Spell they could normally cast individually.

**Highest Check & DC**: Every participant makes their Spell Check to cast the Spell. The highest Spell Check and the highest Save DC among them is used to determine the outcome.

## Stacking Magical Effects
A target can only be affected by a single magical effect of the same name (a single creature can only be mind controlled by 1 person). If there’s a magical effect on a creature and you cast a Spell with the same effect, both casters must perform a Contested Spell Check to determine which Spell effect prevails over the target. The Spellcaster who already has the effect on the creature doesn’t have to spend any additional MP, they get to add a bonus to their roll equal to the base MP of the Spell they cast.

## Miscellaneous Spell Rules
For rules not mentioned here, assume they follow the same rules as DnD 5e.

### Natural 1s
When you make a Spell Check and get a Natural 1 on the d20 the Spell does not go off and it fizzles. You still spend the AP for the attempt, but you don’t spend any MP or other resources. This Spell Check still counts as a Spell Check towards the Multiple Check Penalty.

### Concentration
Some Spells require the caster to maintain Concentration for the effects of that Spell to persist. Things can happen to you (like taking damage) that cause you to make a Mental Save to maintain Concentration. You can only maintain Concentration on 1 effect at a time. If you successfully cast a 2nd Spell that requires Concentration, you lose Concentration on the 1st Spell immediately. 

**Maintaining Concentration**: Whenever you take damage or are put into a distracting or dangerous situation (GM discretion) you have to make a Mental Save in order to maintain Concentration. The DC is equal to 10 or double the amount of damage taken (whichever is higher).

**Concentration DC Formula**
- 10 or 2x damage taken (whichever is higher)

**Losing Concentration**: You immediately lose your Concentration when you become Incapacitated or enter Death’s Door.

#### Sustain
To maintain concentration you must also spend 1 AP to sustain the spell. If you do not sustain the spell your concentration ends. 

## Schools of Magic
### Protection
As its name implies, this school of magic focuses on the protection of the user and those around them. You will most commonly see this school in the form of invisible or translucent magical barriers that protect against harm. It is also the school that encompasses spells that negate other spells or magical effects like "Dispel Magic"

### Conjuration
This school focuses on manipulating mana to give it a physical form for specific purpose. Because of the difficulty of creating physical material from energy, the majority of objects created this way are temporary. You will most commonly see this spell in the form of temporarily creating weapons or traps, allowing the user flexibility without carrying the extra weight. More advanced spells of this school allow users to manifest spirits or spectral creatures. It also includes the creation of magical gates for teleportation or summoning creatures from other spheres. 

### Illusion
This school of magic is often confused with conjuration, but it differs in that nothing is actually created. In some respects, this confusion is purposeful as it allows a less skilled magician to appear more powerful as they can seemingly conjure great creatures of objects. The illusion school of magic also encompasses effects that affect the mind. In its strongest forms, this type of magic allows the user to dominate the mind of another, but it can also affect the dreams of other creatures. While most magicians know some spells form this school, those who specialize in it are considered deeply untrustworthy. 

### Elemental
This school of magic focuses in the manipulation of the four elements: Earth, Water (including ice), Fire, and Air. Of these four elements, fire is the most commonly studied as it can be easily produced from mana and its versatility. In general, for the spells to function some amount of element must be present in the area, but not much of the element is required as the user can effectively amplify the mass of the material. This is most commonly seen in water-based spells as the user can draw water from the moisture in the air or convert ice to water. Because of this the strength of strength of Elemental spells can be affected by the environment. 

### Divination
Divination is the school of enhanced perception, allowing the user to peer into the past, present, and future. This school is largely utilitarian, allowing the user to identify objects, detect magic, and read the intentions of other creatures. The most infamous aspect of this school is perceiving the future. While incredibly useful, the future is fickle and ever in flux, causing many predictions to be incorrect which has led many to see future-focused practitioners as conmen. However, the most powerful Divination users learn to navigate their visions without becoming slaves to them.
 
### Anima
This is the school of manipulating the health of a creature. At the its most basic, those who focus on the Life aspect of this school learn to heal even the most grievous of wounds, while those who focus on the Death aspect can learn to kill with a single touch. However, this is only the surface level aspects. This school can even bring people back from dead, or failing that imbue corpses with a false life. 

### Transmutation
The Transmutation school of magic focus on the transformation of your environment and self. At it's most basic, this allows the user to change the shape and characteristics of the objects and creatures around you. Most commonly, this is used to temporarily enhance a creature or an object. However, more powerful spells allow for shape-shifting and creating artificial life. Notably, this school also allows for the manipulation of metal and the creation of lightning, things that many except to be elemental.  

### Telekinesis
This school focuses on the movement of creatures and objects. Practitioners can lift, push, pull, or restrain targets. At its simplest, Telekinesis allows for tasks like retrieving distant items or opening doors without physical contact. At its most powerful, it can hurl enemies through the air and destroy objects.


## Overlapping Spells
The actual difference between the schools are blurry, so the classification of spells under certain schools can be confusing. This confusion is further amplified by the fact that certain magicians will create versions of existing spells that fall under their specialization. For example, the spell `Hold Person` is traditionally a Telekinesis spell, but a common modification of the spell tricks the mind into believing it cannot move, placing it within the Illusion school of magic.

Mechanically, this allows Players (with permission) and GMs to change the school or damage type of spells.
