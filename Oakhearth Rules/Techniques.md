## Overview
Martial Classes learn new Techniques at certain levels from the Techniques Known column in their Class Table. Techniques differentiate themselves from maneuvers by using Stamina Points. 

### Technique Enhancements
Technique Enhancements allow a Martial character to increase the potency of their Techniques by spending additional SP on the Technique. Technique Enhancements are specific to each Technique and are included in a Technique’s description. Many Technique Enhancements increase a Technique’s damage (if applicable), its duration, its range, its number of targets, or its Area of Effect (if applicable). 

Performing a Technique Enhancement: When you perform a Technique, you can spend additional SP to perform a Technique Enhancement as part of the Technique. If the Technique requires an Attack Check, you must choose to do so before you make the Check. You can perform the same Technique Enhancement only once per Technique, unless it’s stated otherwise.

## Technique List

**Bodyguard**
When a creature you can see within 1 Space is targeted by an Attack, you can spend 1 AP and 1 SP as a Reaction to become the new target of the Check, and choose to switch places with the original target (if it’s willing). If the Check is accompanied by a Save, you make the Save instead of the original target. 

*Enhancements*: 
- Steadfast Forbearance: If multiple creatures within 1 Space of you (after switching places if you choose to do so) are targeted by the same Check, you can attempt to protect them as well. You can spend 1 SP per additional target to become the new target of its Check as well. You take the collective damage of all protected creatures against the Check.
- Immense Defense: You can spend 2 SP to gain Resistance (Half) against all damage taken using this Technique.


**Slip Away**
Trigger: A Creature misses you with an Attack.

Reaction: You can spend 1 AP and 1 SP to take the Full Dodge Action and move up to half of your Speed.

*Enhancements*:
- Diving Attack: You can spend 1 SP to make an Attack Check against a creature within 1 Space of you as part of Slip Away.


**Volley**
Requires: Ranged Weapon

You can spend 2 AP and 1 SP to launch a volley of projectiles. Choose a point within your Weapon’s range. Make a single Attack Check and compare it against the AC
of all creatures of your choice within 1 Space of the chosen point. 

Attack Hit: You deal 2 damage of the Weapon’s type to each creature.

*Enhancements*
- Blanket of Arrows: You can spend 1 SP to increase the area to 3 Spaces from the chosen point.
- Line of Arrows: You can spend 1 SP to also target each creature occupying a Space in a Line between you and the chosen point.


**Whirlwind**
Using a Melee Weapon (or Unarmed Strike), you can spend 2 AP and 1 SP to make a single Attack Check against the AC of all creatures of your choice within 1 Space of you. 

Attack Hit: You deal your Weapon (or Unarmed Strike) damage to each creature. 

Technique Enhancements
- Blood Whirl: You can spend 1 SP to force each creature targeted to make a Physical Save against your Save DC. Failure: They begin Bleeding (1 True damage at the start of their turn until DC 10 Medicine Check). 
- Wide Swing: You can spend 1 SP to increase the range of Whirlwind by 1 Space, targeting each creature of your choice within 2 Spaces of you. 
- Throwing Finisher: If you’re wielding a Melee Weapon, you can choose to spend and extra 1 SP at the end of the Whirlwind to throw the Weapon at a target within 5 Spaces. Use the same single Attack Check against this target as well. The weapon lands within 1 Space of the target (GM discretion).
