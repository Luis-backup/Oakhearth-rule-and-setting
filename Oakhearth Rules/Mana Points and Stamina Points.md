## Stamina Points
Martial PCs have Stamina Points (SP) which can be spent on Techniques and Class Features, and are also used in place of Action Points when performing Martial Maneuvers. 

You can gain SP from the Martial Mastery Feature granted by Martial Classes (Barbarian, Champion, Rogue, etc.), from Talents (such as the Multiclassing Talents), or from Ancestry Features. 

### Regaining SP
You can regain SP during Combat in a variety of ways depending on your Class Features. Whenever you regain SP this way you regain half of your total SP. 

You regain all spent SP when Combat ends. 

### Action Points to Stamina
On your turn, you can spend 2 AP to regain 1 SP.

### Mana to Stamina
Once on each of your turns, you can spend 1 or more MP to regain 1 SP per MP spent.

### SP Outside of Combat
You can perform any Action outside of Combat that uses Stamina without spending any SP, however the SP cost can’t be higher than your SP maximum.

## Mana Points
Spellcasting PCs have Mana Points (MP), which can be spent on Spells, Spell Enhancements, Class Features, and Ancestry Traits.

You can gain MP from the Spellcasting Mastery Feature granted by Spellcasting Classes (Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard, etc.), from Talents (such as the Multiclassing Talents), or from Ancestry Features.

### Regaining MP
You regain all MP when you finish a Long Rest.

### MP Outside of Combat
When you spend MP outside of Combat, the cost is reduced by 1 (minimum of 1).  
The total MP cost before this reduction can’t be greater than your Mana Spend Limit.
