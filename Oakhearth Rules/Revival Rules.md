## Limited Revival
Every creature can only be revived with normal magic a maximum of three times. After three times, and magical spell or effects that attempts to revive the creature automatically fails. 



## Break the Chains of Fate
If your character would die, you can choose to *Break the Chains of Fate*. When you do so, your character is given one last burst of energy that reverberates along the strings of fate. 

When you choose to do this, you regain all of your actions points, and any action you take is treated as an automatic success. 

If you choose to *Break the Chains of Fate*, your character cannot be revived by any known magic or god.
