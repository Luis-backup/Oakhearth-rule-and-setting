Your character's Ancestry represents reflects their biology and family history. Each Ancestry has a set of Core Traits and a set of Secondary Traits. When you choose an Ancestry you take all of the Core Traits and choose two of the Secondary Traits.

## Multiple Ancestries
Many people can trace their lineage to multiple groups. Because of this, you can choose to take the effect of two Ancestries (Realistically a person can trace their family tree to more than two groups, so this is purely a mechanical limitation). When you choose to take two ancestries, you receive the Core Traits from the first Ancestry and the Secondary Traits from the second Ancestry.
