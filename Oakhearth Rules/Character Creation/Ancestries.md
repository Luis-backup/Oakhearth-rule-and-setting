Your character's Ancestry represents reflects their biology and family history. Each Ancestry has a set of Core Traits and a set of Secondary Traits. When you choose an Ancestry you take all of the Core Traits and choose two of the Secondary Traits.

## Multiple Ancestries
Many people can trace their lineage to multiple groups. Because of this, you can choose to take the effect of two Ancestries (Realistically a person can trace their family tree to more than two groups, so this is purely a mechanical limitation). When you choose to take two ancestries, you receive the Core Traits from the first Ancestry and the Secondary Traits from the second Ancestry. 

## Common Ancestries
These groups of people can be found throughout the world in large groups, either in their own civilizations or in combined civilizations. To all but the most isolated people, seeing a person of any of these ancestries does not pose any questions.
