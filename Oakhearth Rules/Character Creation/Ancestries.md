Your character's Ancestry represents reflects their biology and family history. Each Ancestry has a set of Core Traits and a set of Secondary Traits. When you choose an Ancestry you take all of the Core Traits and choose two of the Secondary Traits.

## Multiple Ancestries
Many people can trace their lineage to multiple groups. Because of this, you can choose to take the effect of two Ancestries (Realistically a person can trace their family tree to more than two groups, so this is purely a mechanical limitation). When you choose to take two ancestries, you receive the Core Traits from the first Ancestry and the Secondary Traits from the second Ancestry. 

## Common Ancestries
These groups of people can be found throughout the world in large groups, either in their own civilizations or in combined civilizations. To all but the most isolated people, seeing a person of any of these ancestries does not pose any questions.

### Dwarves
Dwarves are a short and stout people. They typically stand between 4.5' and 5' tall. All Dwarves grow beards, and most Dwarf societies take pride in maintaining them regardless of gender. Dwarves skin tones are very similar to those of Humans with Dwarves living near volcanic activity being dark in skin tone and those living in poorly lit areas being notably pale. 

Dwarves reach adulthood at 30 years old and most live to be around 150, with the oldest known Dwarves reach 200

### Elves
Elves are innately tuned to nature, and as a result most Elf communities are found in forests and other places with dense plant life. Most Elves stand between 5'5 and 5'10 in height. Physically, Elves tend to be lean with less body fat than humans, often making them appear endogenous to non-elves. However, their appearance does not negatively affect their strength. Regarding skin tones, they tend to resemble the color of trees common to the area in which an Elf is born. This often results in brown skin tones, but areas with more uniquely colored trees like Birch commonly lead to non-brown skin tones. Regarding hair, most Elves have brown hair with Dark Green and Shades of orange being less common. Elf ears are similar slightly smaller than those of humans and notably more pointed. 

Elves reach adulthood at 50 and most live to be around 200. The maximum age of Elves is unknown.
