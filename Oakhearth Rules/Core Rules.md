## Dice: 
Oakhearth primarily uses a d20 for gameplay, but players should also have at least one of each of the following: d4, d8, d10, and d12.

## Advantage/Disadvantage (ADV/DIS): 
Certain abilities or situations may grant you Advantage (ADV) or Disadvantage (DIS). You can have up to 3 ADV or DIS at a time. Each ADV cancels out one DIS and vice versa. For every ADV you have, roll one additional die and use the highest result. For every DIS you have, roll one additional die and use the lowest result.

## Attributes:
Oakhearth features 4 attributes that define your character:
- Might: Represents physical strength and fortitude.
- Dexterity: Reflects agility, flexibility, and balance.
- Intelligence: Measures knowledge and mental acuity.
- Charisma: Captures your ability to understand and influence others.

The value of an attribute is added to relevant skills and defenses.

### Prime Attribute:
Your Prime Attribute is your highest Attribute value. It is added to your Attack Rolls.

## Proficiency Level (PL):
Proficiency Levels represent your skill with a particular Skill. There are 5 Skill Proficiency Levels. You can spend Skill Points to increase your Proficiency Level in a given Skill. 

## Rounding Rules:
Always round down when calculating values, with a minimum result of 1. The exception to this is if you have Resistance to a damage type, in this case you can round down to 0. 

## Action Points (AP):
Each player has 4 Action Points (AP) by default. This number can be temporarily increased or decreased based on circumstances. Action Points are used in combat or other time-sensitive situations. You regain Action Points at the end of your turn. In combat, you can spend an AP to give yourself ADV on an Attack check. 

## Degrees of Success:
When rolling a d20, add all relevant bonuses to the result. If the total exceeds the target value by 5 or more, you usually gain an additional effect. This rule is most commonly applied to Attack Rolls: for every 5 points your roll exceeds the target's defense, you deal 1 extra point of damage.

## Difficulty Challenge (DC): 
The Difficulty Challenge (DC) represents how hard it is to succeed at a particular task. When attempting to overcome a challenge, your total roll (including all modifiers) must be equal to or greater than the DC to succeed.
