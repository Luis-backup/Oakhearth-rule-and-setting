## Mana, Magic, and Spells
### Definitions
Mana is effectively the fuel for Magic, and Spells are a structured form of Magic.

Mana is in everything as it is a fundamental aspect of the universe.

### Spell Origin
There are 3 Spell Origins: Arcane, Divine, and Primal. A Spell Origin is largely a flavor feature, the explains the method and source of your spellcasting. The Wizard class must choose the Arcane spell origin. The other spellcasting classes can flavor their magic with any Spell Origin.

**Arcane**
Arcane magic is the refinement of the raw mana of the world. It is based on knowledge of Magic Sigils and thus can be learned without a naturally strong connection to mana. This has led it to be considered more reliable than the other Spell Origins.

**Faith**
Divine magic draws power from divine beings, such as deities their followers, or the manifestations of abstract universal concepts.

**Primordial**
Primal magic draws power from the physical embodiment of the universe (the land, air, rivers, and fires) and the natural creatures that abide within it (plants, animals, and nature spirits).
