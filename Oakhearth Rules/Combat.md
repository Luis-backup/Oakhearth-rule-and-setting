## Initiative Rules
At the start of combat, each group of combatants makes a Contested Group Check to determine turn order. This check uses the Initiative Bonus of each creature, with a default Difficulty Challenge (DC) of 13. However, the DC may vary based on factors such as environmental conditions, like bad weather, or other situational modifiers.

The group with the higher number of successes wins and acts first at the beginning of each round. Combat follows an alternating activation system, where a member of one group takes their turn, followed by a member of the opposing group, continuing this pattern until all participants have acted. The actual order of activation within each group is decided by the DM and players respectively, and it can change from round to round. The group that wins the Contested Group Check decides which of their members acts first. In the event of a tie, the DM resolves turn order based on context or by rolling to break the tie. 

### Initiative Bonus
Each player has an Initiative Bonus, calculated as follows:
- Initiative = Highest Physical Attribute (Might or Dexterity) + Combat Proficiency.  

### Uneven number of Creatures
When one group of combatants outnumbers the other, the larger group activates in smaller sub-groups to maintain balance. This ensures that each side alternates turns evenly, with the larger group dividing its activations across the round as needed.

## Time in Combat
Time in combat is measured in Rounds. Each Round is 6 seconds.

## Surprise
Combat begins only when the GM instructs the players to roll for initiative. However, players and NPCs may use stealth or other tactics to gain an advantage before combat starts. If one group is caught off guard, they gain the Surprised condition and automatically fail their initiative checks.

Surprised Condition: When you have the Surprised condition you can't spend Action Points and are Exposed (Attack checks against them have ADV)

## Action Points (AP):
Each player has 4 Action Points (AP) by default, but some creatures may have fewer or more. This number can be temporarily increased or decreased based on circumstances. Action Points are used in combat or other time-sensitive situations. You regain Action Points at the end of your turn. 

## Actions and Reactions in Combat
Anything that requires spending Action Points (AP) is considered an Action if it occurs during your turn. To take an Action, you must spend the AP cost specified in the Action’s description. If you spend Action Points outside of your turn, it is considered a Reaction. Reactions usually require a specific trigger, such as an enemy moving out of range or an ally being attacked, and they also have an AP cost outlined in their description.

### Free Object Interactions
Once per turn, you can perform a simple, quick action that does not require spending AP. This is called a Free Object Interaction.
 Examples include:
-  picking up a small item
- retrieving or storing something on your person
- pulling a lever.

These rules are intentionally flexible to accommodate a variety of situations. If there is any uncertainty about whether an action qualifies as a Free Object Interaction, the group can discuss it, but the GM has the final say.

Additional Object Interactions: If you want to perform more than one object interaction in a turn, you can spend 1 AP to do so.


### Offensive Actions
**Attack (1 AP)**
You make 1 Attack Check. For each additional AP you use, you gain a level of ADV.


**Disarm (1 AP)**
Choose a creature within your weapon’s range. Make an Attack Check, and the target contests it using either Athletics, Acrobatics, or Sleight of Hand. If your Attack Check succeeds, the target drops the object they are holding.

The target gains Advantage for every additional limb they are using to hold the object. Additionally, you have Disadvantage if the target is larger than you, or Advantage if the target is smaller than you. However, you cannot target a creature that is two size categories larger or smaller than you. 


**Grapple (1 AP)**
If you have a free hand, you can attempt to Grapple a creature. To do this, make an Athletics check contested by the targeted creature's Physical Check. You have ADV on the check if you are larger than the target and DIS if you are smaller than the target. You cannot Target creatures that are two or more size categories larger or smaller than you. On a success, the target creature has the Grappled condition.


**Shove (1 AP)**
You attempt to push a creature within 1 Space of you. Make an Athletics Check contested by the target’s Physical Check. On a success, you push the creature 1 Space away from you or to its left or right. For every 5 points your roll exceeds the target’s roll, you can push the creature 1 additional Space. After resolving the push, you can choose to reduce the total distance the target is pushed by 1 Space to knock them Prone instead.


**Tackle (1 AP)**
If you move at least 2 Spaces in a straight line, you can attempt to Tackle a creature that’s your size or smaller. Make an Athletics Check contested by the target’s Martial Check. On a success, you Grapple the target, and you both move 1 Space in the same direction you were moving. Immediately after moving, you and the target fall Prone.


### Defensive Actions

**Disengage (1 AP)**  
You can spend 1 AP to impose Disadvantage on Attacks of Opportunity made against you until the start of your next turn. When you take the Disengage Action, you can spend an additional 1 AP to become immune to Attacks of Opportunity until the start of your next turn.


**Dodge (1 AP)**  
You can spend 1 AP to impose Disadvantage on the next Attack or Grapple made against you before the start of your next turn. When you take the Dodge Action, you can spend an additional 1 AP to impose Disadvantage on all Attacks or Grapples made against you until the start of your next turn.

  
**Hide (1 AP)**  
You can spend 1 AP to attempt to Hide from 1 or more creatures that can’t see you (Unseen). Make a Stealth Check against the opposing creature’(s) Passive Awareness. On a success, you become Hidden from creatures whose Passive Awareness you beat (making you Unseen and Unheard by them). You remain Hidden until you make a noise louder than a whisper, make an Attack, cast a Spell with a Verbal Component, or a creature takes the Search Action and successfully locates you.


**Help (1 AP)**
You can spend 1 AP to grant an ally a d8 Help Die until the start of your next turn.
Declare the target creature and the type of Check you're aiding:
- Attack: You must be within 1 Space of the attacker or target. The die can be added to an Attack against the declared target.
The Help Die is consumed when used and applies only to the declared Check.

*Multiple Help Penalty*: Each additional Help Action taken before the end of your turn reduces subsequent Help Dice by one step (d8, d6, d4). 

Object Interaction (1 AP)  
Unlike Free Object Interactions, these are more complex manipulations and always require spending 1 AP. These include but are not limited to:  
- Drinking a Potion or Administering a Potion to another Creature.
- Attempting to Lock or Unlock a Lock.
- Making a Sleight of Hand Check to activate or disable a trap or other mechanism.
- Transferring an Item to or from another Creature (only 1 of the two creatures spends 1 AP).
- Throwing an Item to location you can see up to 5 Spaces away.

### Held Actions
When combat conditions aren't optimal for your intended action, you may hold it for later execution:
1. Declare Action and Pay Cost
   Immediately spend the required AP for your chosen action. All Multiple Check Penalties from your current turn apply to this Reaction.

2. Specify Trigger Condition 
   Define an observable game event that will activate your held action, such as "when the orc enters melee range" or "after my ally moves to safety." This trigger cannot be altered once set.

3. Resolve when Triggered
   If the trigger occurs before your next turn, you may interrupt the event to execute your action as a Reaction. Any additional resource costs are paid at activation. The AP is lost if the trigger doesn't occur.

Valid triggers include (but aren't limited to):
- Enemy movement/positioning
- Ally actions completing  
- Environmental changes
- Specific combat events (spellcasting, item use)

### Move Action
When you take the Move Action you can move a number of spaces equal to your Speed. You can split your Move action. Example: If you have 6 Speed, you can move 3 spaces, attack, and then move 3 spaces away. 

You can take more than one Move Action per round, but each time you do, your Speed is halved. You cannot take the Move Action more than 3 times.
- 1st Move Action: You move your Speed
- 2nd Move Action: You move half your Speed
- 3rd Move Action: You move a quarter of your Speed

### Reactions  
Reactions are types actions taken in response to specific triggers during another creature's turn. A creature cannot normally take reactions during its own turn unless responding to another reaction.

Taking Reactions:
To take a reaction, a creature must meet both:  
- The prerequisite (required feature like Martial or Spellcasting)  
- The trigger condition (specific game event)  
Only one reaction can be taken per trigger instance. For example, when an enemy leaves reach, only one opportunity attack may be made regardless of available action points.

**Action Point Costs**  
Spending AP on reactions reduces your available AP pool on your next turn:  
- AP spent on reactions isn't refunded until your turn ends  
- If all AP is spent before your turn, you begin with 0 AP  
- Multiple different reactions may be taken if triggers occur and AP is available

#### Attacks of Opportunity
*Prerequisite:* Martial Proficiency   
*Trigger:* When a visible creature within your melee range:  
- Moves out of your reach  
- Stands up from prone  
- Picks up an object  
- Switches Weapons
- Takes an Object Interaction  

*Effect:* Spend 1 AP to make a melee martial attack against the triggering creature. You may spend additional AP to:  
- Gain advantage on the attack  
- Perform compatible combat maneuvers  


## Spellcasting in Combat
Spells can be used as Actions or Reactions based on their description. They may also require more than 1 AP to cast. 

### Spell Duels
Spell Duels are a magic counter to seeing a spell being cast. 

*Prerequisite:* Spellcasting Proficiency  
*Trigger:* A visible creature begins casting any spell.

*Reaction*: You declare a Spell Duel and spend 2 AP and 1 or more MP to challenge the creature with a Spell of your own. You can declare a Spell Duel after the creature makes
its Spell Check but before you know the result of its Check.

*Multiple Participants*: Additional creatures can choose to participate in helping the Spell take effect or participate in stopping the Spell from taking effect. If multiple creatures choose to participate in the Spell Duel, the participants are sorted into **Initiators** (those trying to help the Spell take effect) and **Challengers** (those trying to prevent the Spell from taking effect). During the Contest every participant makes their Spell Check, and the highest Initiator result is compared against the highest Challenger result to determine the outcome.

#### Choosing a Spell
You declare which Spell you are using to challenge the opposing Spell and then describe how you do so using your Spell. The GM decides if that makes sense.
- Note: You are not actually casting this Spell as stated in its description, you are instead using the “flavor” of the Spell to be how you initiate the Spell Duel. The only part of the Spell’s mechanics that matter is its Range and/ or Area of Effect.

*Targeted*: If your chosen Spell targets 1 or more creatures or objects, you must be able to target the opposing creature or any of its targets with your Spell.

*Area of Effect*: If your chosen Spell covers an area (such as an Arc, Cone, Cube, Cylinder, Line, or Sphere), then your Spell’s Area of Effect must include the opposing creature, any of its targets, or cover an area between the opposing creature and any of its targets.

*Success and Failure*: The success and failure statements of your Spell are replaced by the success and failure statements in the Contest section below.

#### Contest
The Spell Check the opposing creature makes to cast its Spell is Contested by the Spell Check you make to cast your Spell. When comparing the Spell Checks for the purpose of determining the winner of the Contest, each creature gains a bonus to its Check equal to the MP it spent on its Spell. 
- Success: The target creature’s Spell fails and has no effect.
- Failure: The target creature’s Spell succeeds and takes effect.
- Tie: The target creature’s Spell fails, has no effect.
- Whatever the result, each creature still spends all AP, MP, or other resources they spent to cast their Spell.

## Collisions
When a creature is thrown or knocked back and collides with an immovable object (such as a wall) or another creature, it takes damage upon impact.
- Spaces: A creature stops in the Space where it made contact with the object or creature.
- Damage: A creature takes an amount of Bludgeoning damage equal to the number of Spaces it couldn’t travel (due to the collision).
- Creature Collision: If a thrown creature or falling creature collides with another creature they both share the damage (each take half)

### Falling Attacks
If you want to put more force into an Attack Check, you can purposefully fall onto a target as part of your Attack Check. To do this, you first need to move into a position to fall onto the target. Using the Creature Collision rules from above, you would count up the Spaces fallen and this number will represent the falling damage that will be taken. You can now make your Attack Check and resolve the damage based on the result. Then (regardless of if you hit or miss) you would share the damage taken from the fall. You would take half of the damage and the other half would be added to the damage they take as part of the same Attack Check.

## Throwing Creatures
You can spend 1 AP to throw a creature that’s Grappled by you that’s the same size as you or smaller. Make an Athletics Check Contested by the target’s Physical Check. *Success*: You throw the creature up to a number of Spaces away from you equal to 1/2 of your Might (ending the Grappled Condition) + up to 1 additional Space for every 5 they fail the Contest by.
- Smaller Size: If the creature is a size smaller than you, the distance thrown is equal to your Might (instead of half).
- Vertical Toss: You can choose throw the creature vertically into the air. When you do, they distance thrown is halved.
- Team Throw: If another creature has the same target Grappled, that other creature can spend 1 AP as a reaction to throw the target with you. You and the other creature each make an Athletics Check and add your results together to determine the total number of Spaces the target is thrown.
- Throw at a Target: If you throw a creature at a target, you must make an Athletics Check and compare it to the target’s AC. Hit: The thrown creature and the target share the Collision damage (each take half) Miss: The thrown creature continues traveling up to the distance thrown or until it impacts an immovable object (such as a wall) and takes full Collision damage.

## Improvised Weapons
Unless otherwise stated by the GM, an Improvised Weapons deals 1 damage of a type determined by the GM. When making an Attack Check with an Improvised Weapon you only add your Prime Modifier to your d20 roll, you don’t add your Combat Proficiency. 

*Weapon Style*: Unless otherwise stated by the GM, an Improvised Weapon doesn’t benefit from Weapon Styles or Weapon Properties.


## Unarmed Strikes
Unarmed Strikes deal 0 Bludgeoning damage. An Unarmed Strike is a Melee Attack made using any part of a creature’s own body, such as a Punch, Elbow, Kick, Knee, or Headbutt.

## Non-Lethal Attacks
When you make a Melee Attack with a Weapon or Unarmed Strike, you can declare the Attack to be Non-Lethal. If a creature is reduced to 0 HP or lower by a Non-Lethal Attack, they are knocked Unconscious instead and are considered Stable for the purposes of Death’s Door. 

If a creature is knocked Unconscious in this way, another creature can spend 1 AP to shake them awake. When the creature awakens, they are on Death’s Door at 0 HP, regardless of how much damage was dealt by the Non-Lethal Attack.

## Dual Wielding
You are considered to be **Dual Wielding** when you have 2 free hands or 2 hands wielding 1-Handed Weapons. While Dual Wielding, when you make an Attack with one hand followed be a second Attack with the other hand, the 2nd Attack ignores the Multiple Check Penalty and doesn't advance that penalty. You can ignore the Multiple Check Penalty in this way once per turn. 

## Flanking
You gain ADV to your Melee Attack if the target is Flanked. A creature is Flanked when it has 2 or more enemies within 1 space of it that are not adjacent to each other, provided they aren't Incapacitated or Prone.

## Underwater Combat
While underwater creatures are subjected to the following effects:
- Attack Penalties: Melee Attack are made with DIS unless the weapon is a Crossbow or Spear. Creatures with a Swim Speed ignore this penalty. Additionally, Ranged Attacks automatically miss the target beyond the weapon's normal range.
- Holding Breath: Creatures that attempt to speak while holding, such as to satisfy the Verbal Component of a Spell, reduce their breath duration by 1. 
- Fire Resistance: Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have Fire Resistance (Half).
