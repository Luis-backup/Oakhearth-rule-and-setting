# Checks
Checks are used when attempting actions with a chance of failure. They are typically required for skill-based tasks, physical challenges, or problem-solving scenarios.

## Willing Creatures
Any creature can choose to willingly fail a Check or Save. When this choice is made:
- The result of the Check or Save is treated as a 0 for determining degrees of success or failure.
- The creature does not suffer the effects of a Critical Failure unless they explicitly choose to accept those effects.

## Types of Checks
There are several types of Checks, each used in different situations.

### Flat Attribute Checks
When a creature attempts an activity that does not benefit from Proficiency, they perform a Flat Attribute Check. These checks rely solely on the creature’s raw attribute value without adding Proficiency Points.
- Flat Attribute Check = d20 + Attribute

Example: A Flat Intelligence Check could be used to recall a past conversation.

### Attack Checks
When a creature attempts to hit a target with an Unarmed Strike or Weapon, they make an Attack Check to determine if their attack hits the target.
- Attack Check = d20 + Prime Attribute + Combat Proficiency

### Spell Checks
When a creature casts a Spell, they make a Spell Check to determine the potency of the Spell or if the Spell hits its target.
- Spell Check = d20 + Prime Attribute + Combat Proficiency

### Skill Checks
When a creature attempts a test of skill, they perform a Skill Check. Each skill is associated with an Attribute, and Proficiency Points (PP) can be added to the roll if applicable.
- Skill Check = d20 + Attribute + Proficiency Points

### Physical Check
When a creature attempts an action that could reasonably be accomplished using either Athletics or Acrobatics, they use the skill with the higher bonus.

### Contested Checks
When two or more creatures directly oppose each other, success is determined by comparing their rolls. Each creature rolls using the relevant skill or attribute and adds any applicable bonuses. The creature with the higher total succeeds. In the case of a tie, the result is usually a stalemate or favors the defending creature, depending on the circumstances.

## Group Checks
When multiple creatures work together to complete the same task, the GM sets the DC for the Skill Check. Each participating creature rolls for the check. The GM compares the number of successful rolls to the number of failed rolls.
- If the group has more successes than failures, the task is completed successfully.
- Otherwise, the group fails.

### Degrees of Success in Group Checks
- For every 5 points a creature rolls above the DC, count it as an additional success.
- For every 5 points a creature rolls below the DC, count it as an additional failure.

### Natural 1's and 20's
- Rolling a natural 1 adds one extra failure to the Group Check.
- Rolling a natural 20 adds one extra success.
After accounting for these, apply the appropriate modifiers to determine the final roll result.

### Contested Group Checks
When a Group Check opposes another group's task, use a Contested Group Check. Calculate each group's total number of successes for the given DC, subtracting any failures from the total successes. The group with the higher net successes wins the Contested Group Check.

## Passive Skills
In some situations, the GM may determine the success of a Check without requiring a roll. Instead, they use the skill's Passive Value to assess the outcome. This is particularly useful for ongoing activities or when a roll might disrupt the flow of gameplay.
- Passive Value = 8 + any bonuses to Skill

### Permanent ADV and DIS
If you have an effect that grants you a permanent ADV or DIS to a Skill Check, then you add (ADV) or subtract (DIS) 2 to your Passive Skill for each instance of
ADV or DIS.


## Multiple Check Penalty
During Combat, each time a creature makes the same Check before the end of its turn, they suffer stacking DIS on that type of Check, such as specific Flat Attribute Checks, Attack Checks, Spell Checks, and Skill Checks. This penalty only applies to Checks made during the creature’s turn, and doesn’t apply to Reactions taken on another creature’s turn (unless otherwise stated).

## Note on Failed Checks
Failing a skill check does not always mean your character is completely incapable of completing the task. Instead, failure might represent:
- An inability to perform the action efficiently (e.g., taking too much time or struggling under pressure).
- External factors, such as stress or distractions, prevent your character from focusing.
The exact interpretation of a failed check is left to the player and GM to determine based on the situation.

# Saves
Saves occur when a PC reacts against an effect being forced upon them.

## Attribute Saves
Most Saves are associated with a specific Attribute:
- Might Saves: Resist effects that push you away, knock you down, or crush you. 
- Dexterity Saves: Resist effects that cause you to lose your balance or that can be avoided by successfully dodging out of the way. 
- Charisma Saves: Resist effects that attempt to dominate your mind or alter your emotions. 
- Intelligence Saves: Resist effects that attempt to read your thoughts, alter your memories, confuse you, or use illusions to deceive your senses.

When a creature is subjected to an effect, they make the an Attribute Save to determine whether or not they’re able to resist the effect. The Attribute used to make the Save is determined by the effect (or the GM).

### Attribute Save Formula
- d20 + Attribute + Combat Proficiency

## Special Saves
### Death Saves  
When a creature makes a Death Save, it rolls a d20. If the result is 10 or higher it succeeds on its Death Save.

### Physical Saves
When an effect targets your overall physical abilities, you make a Physical Save. Your Physical Save bonus is equal to your Might Save bonus or Agility Save bonus, whichever is higher.  

### Mental Saves
When an effect targets your overall mental abilities, you make a Mental Save. Your Mental Save bonus is equal to your Charisma Save bonus or Intelligence Save bonus, whichever is higher.

## Save DC
Your Save DC represents the difficulty a creature would have to resist your static effects (such as Traps) and ongoing effects (such as Spells). Every creature has a Save DC, which is equal to 10 + its Prime Modifier + its Combat Proficiency.

### Save DC Formula  
10 + Prime Modifier + Combat Proficiency

### Repeated Saves
When a creature fails a Save against an effect that has the Repeated Save statement, it can repeat its Save at the end of each of its turns. When that happens, the creature repeats its Save against a Save DC (instead of the original opposing Check).


### Dynamic Attack Saves
Some Game Features both deal damage and impose an effect on their target. This triggers what is called a Dynamic Attack Save. The provoking creature makes an Attack Check (or Spell Check) at the same time that the target makes its Save. The provoking creature’s Check is compared against the target’s Defense to determine if the target takes damage, and the target’s Save is compared against the provoking creature’s Save DC to determine if the target is subjected to the effect.

**Dynamic Attack Save Outcomes**
A Dynamic Attack Save can result in 1 of 4 outcomes:  
- Attack Hit & Save Failure: The target takes damage and is subjected to the effect.  
- Attack Miss & Save Failure: The target does not take damage but is subjected to the effect.  
- Attack Hit & Save Success: The target takes damage but is not subjected to the effect.  
- Attack Miss & Save Success: The target does not take damage and is not subjected to the effect.
