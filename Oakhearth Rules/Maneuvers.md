## Overview
Maneuvers are Martial abilities to perform feats of strength and agility on the battlefield. You gain access to these through gaining a Martial Mastery Feature from being a Martial Class or certain Subclasses. If a Spellcaster Class spends a Talent to get a Martial Class Feature they also gain access to Maneuvers through the Multiclass Martial Feature. You can spend AP to perform one or multiple Maneuvers, which allow PCs with Martial Mastery to enhance their offensive and defensive abilities in combat. You can use the same Maneuver multiple times, unless it’s stated otherwise. There are several types of Maneuvers:
- Attack: Attack Maneuvers modify your Martial Attacks with additional damage, range, or targets.  
- Save: Save Maneuvers modify your Martial Attacks with additional effects that impose debilitating Conditions.  
- Grapple: Grapple Maneuvers modify your Grapple Checks with additional slams, pins, throws, and other effects.  
- Defense: Defense Maneuvers enable you to avoid or mitigate taking damage by blocking, deflecting, or dodging Attacks.

### Multiple Maneuvers
You can’t perform the same Maneuver more than once per Attack or Trigger, unless otherwise stated.

### Maneuver Damage
If a Maneuver deals damage, it deals the same type of damage as the Weapon or Unarmed Strike you’re using to perform the Maneuver, unless stated otherwise.

### Save Effects
Some Maneuvers force the target to make a Save against your Save DC or suffer a chosen effect. If you force a creature to Save against the effects of multiple Maneuvers that are a part of the same Attack, the target only makes 1 Save against all Physical Save effects.

### Contest Effects
Some Maneuvers force a Contest between you and the target creature. If you initiate a Contest with a creature against the effects of multiple Maneuvers, you and the target participate in 1 Contest for all effects.

### Spending Stamina
You can spend SP in place of Action Points when performing a Martial Maneuver.

## Attack Maneuvers
When you make a Martial Attack, you can spend additional AP to perform an Attack Maneuver as part of the Attack. You must choose to do so before you make the Attack Check.

**Extend Attack**  
Maneuver: (1 AP) Your Melee Attack Range is increased by 1 Space (or your Ranged Attack Range is increased by 5 Spaces) for the Attack.

**Power Attack**  
Maneuver: (1 AP) You deal +1 damage with the Attack. You can use this Maneuver multiple times.

**Sweep Attack**  
Maneuver: (1 AP) Choose 1 additional target within 1 Space of the original target that’s within your Attack Range. Make 1 Attack Check against all targets.  
**Attack Hit**: The original target takes your Attack’s damage, and each additional target Hit takes 1 damage of the same type. You can use this Maneuver multiple times.


## Save Maneuvers
When you make a Martial Attack, you can spend additional AP to perform a Save Maneuver with the Attack. When you do, the target makes a Physical Save against your Save DC.  
- Save Failure: The target suffers the effects of your Maneuver.

**Hamstring**  
Maneuver: (1 AP) The target becomes Slowed (every 1 Space you move costs an extra 1 Space of movement) until the end of your next turn.

**Knockback**  
Maneuver: (1 AP) The target is pushed 1 Space away + up to 1 additional Space for every 5 it fails its Save by.

**Trip**  
Maneuver: (2 AP) The target falls Prone.

## Grapple Maneuvers
When you attempt to Grapple a creature, you can spend additional AP to perform a Grapple Maneuver as part of the Grapple attempt. You must choose to do so before you make the Grapple Check.  

Grapple Success: The target is Grappled and suffers the damage or effects of your Maneuver.

You can also perform Grapple Maneuvers on creatures you have Grappled. When you perform a Grapple Maneuver against a creature you have Grappled, you make an Athletics Check Contested by the target’s Physical Check.

Contest Success: The target suffers the damage or effects of your Maneuver.  
Contest Failure: The target suffers no additional effects but remains Grappled by you.

**Meat Shield**  
Trigger: You are targeted by an Attack.  
Reaction (Maneuver): (1 AP) You reposition a creature Grappled by you to shield yourself from damage. You and the Grappled creature take half the damage dealt by the attack and you can move the Grappled creature to any space adjacent to you immediately afterwards.

**Restrain**  
Maneuver: (1 AP) The target is Restrained until the Grapple ends. On its turn it can spend 1 AP to end being Restrained, but it remains Grappled until the Condition ends.  

**Slam**  
Maneuver: (1 AP) The target takes 1 Bludgeoning damage.  
Success (each 5): +1 damage.

**Takedown**  
Maneuver: (1 AP) The target falls Prone. You don’t fall Prone unless you choose to do so.

**Throw**  
Requires: The Grappled creature is your Size or smaller.  
Maneuver: (1 AP) The target is thrown up to a number of Spaces away from you equal to 1/2 of your Might (ending the Grappled Condition) + up to 1 additional Space for every 5 they fail the Contest


## Defense Maneuvers
The Defense Maneuvers are taken to protect your allies or in Reaction to a trigger (an Attack Check, Spell Check, or Contest).

**Reaction Maneuvers**: Some Maneuvers allow you to use a Reaction when a creature is targeted by an Attack. For such Maneuvers, you can wait until after the Check is made, but you must decide to use the Maneuver before the GM says the result of the Check.

**Parry**  
Trigger: When a creature you can see within 1 Space (including yourself) is targeted by an Attack against its AC.  
Reaction (Maneuver): (1 AP) You grant the target a bonus to AC equal to your weapon attack bonus against this Attack.

**Protect**  
Trigger: A creature you can see within 1 Space is Hit by an Attack against its AC.  
Reaction (Maneuver): (1 AP) The target takes half of the damage and you take the other half. The damage you take bypasses any Damage Reduction.

**Side Step**  
Trigger: You’re targeted by an Attack against your AC.  
Reaction (Maneuver): (1 AP) You move 1 Space to a Space that’s still within the Attack’s range. When you do, the Attack has DIS against you. If you move behind Cover, gain the benefit of that Cover against the Attack.

**Swap**  
Maneuver: (1 AP) You switch Spaces with a willing creature within 1 Space. If this movement would provoke an Opportunity Attack against you or the target creature, any Opportunity Attacks are made against you.

**Raise Shield**
Reaction (1 AP): When you would take damage from an Attack (not a Saving Throw), the shield takes the damage instead. If the shield is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed. However, if the shield is magical (or otherwise impervious to non-magical destruction), it is not destroyed. Instead, you cannot use this Reaction with that shield again until you finish a Long Rest.
