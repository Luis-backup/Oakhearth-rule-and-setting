This is a fantastic and rich premise. The tone you're describing—"serious political intrigue juxtaposed against goofy animal shenanigans"—is the perfect sweet spot for a memorable campaign. Let's build this world.

### **The Faith of the Deepwoods: The Triune Aspects**
This faith is the common cultural bedrock of the Woodland, predating the city-states and now interpreted differently by each faction.

*   **The Black Wolf (The Guardian in Shadow):** Represents death, endings, secrets, protection, and the necessary darkness that gives contrast to light. Not evil, but solemn. Prayers are offered to the Wolf for safe passage through dark woods, for the peace of the departed, and for the strength to keep necessary secrets. Its symbol is a silhouetted wolf against a full moon.
*   **The Silver Rabbit (The Watcher in the Rafters):** Represents the moon, cycles, reflection, intuition, and subtle change. The Rabbit is associated with diplomacy, dreams, spies, and the quiet turning of fate. Followers ask the Rabbit for guidance in negotiations, for clarity in dreams, and for patience. Its symbol is a rabbit in a crescent moon.
*   **The Golden Eagle (The Judge in the Open Sky):** Represents the sun, truth, law, open conflict, and decisive action. The Eagle’s gaze misses nothing. It is invoked for justice in daylight courts, for courage in battle, and for clear, unambiguous truth. Its symbol is a soaring eagle with the sun as its halo.

**Core Tenet:** "Nature holds all three in its heart. To deny one is to lose balance." A "balanced soul" respects all Aspects.

**Faction Interpretations:**
*   **Marquise de Cat:** Publicly venerates the Golden Eagle (order, law, productivity). Privately, their spymasters worship the Black Wolf.
*   **Eyrie Dynasties:** Officially worship the Golden Eagle (martial glory, solar nobility) and the Silver Rabbit (ancestral cycles, dynastic fate). They see the Black Wolf as a peasant's superstition.
*   **Woodland Alliance:** Their folk faith heavily emphasizes the Silver Rabbit (the underdog, subtle rebellion) and the Black Wolf (the memory of martyrs, protection of the hidden). They view the Eagle as the Aspect of oppressive authority.

### **Overarching Plot: The Maplewood Gambit**
The campaign is a three-way cold war for Maplewood’s soul, destined to go hot. The party starts as relatively unimportant locals who get embroiled in the intrigue and become the key power brokers.

**Act 1: Sap and Secrets (Levels 1-4)**
The party is in Maplewood during the "Diplomatic Season." A minor crisis (a sabotage at the Sap House, a missing council member’s aide, a theft from the town shrine) pulls them in. Through investigation, they meet all the faction reps and uncover that each is not just lobbying, but actively running covert operations to destabilize the others and curry favor. The town council is fracturing under the pressure. The party chooses who to help and who to thwart, earning friends and enemies.

**Act 2: The Uneasy Peace Shatters (Levels 5-8)**
An inciting incident—likely an assassination of a major NPC, framed to look like another faction’s work—breaks the tacit truce. The Marquise might move a patrol to the "protect" the town, the Eyrie might demand the right to garrison, and the Alliance’s new leader seizes the moment to launch a violent, symbolic strike. Maplewood is now a powder keg. The party must navigate open sabotage, propaganda, and skirmishes while trying to uncover the *real* culprit behind the inciting incident (who could be a fourth party or an extremist from one of the three).

**Act 3: The Fate of the Deepwoods (Levels 9-12)**
War erupts in the region. Maplewood, because of its resources and central location, becomes the strategic prize. The party, now heroes/infamous in their own right, must decide Maplewood’s—and by extension, the Deepwoods’—fate. Do they help one faction conquer it? Broker a fragile coalition? Or inspire Maplewood to declare its independence and become the heart of a new, free federation, fighting off all comers? The final battles will be on the streets of their home.

### **First Session Hook:**
The party is in **The Dripping Tap Tavern** during the Maple Sap Festival. A jovial, drunken competition is interrupted when **Warden Grimshaw** bursts in, looking for "any able-bodied souls." The **Sap House** has been sabotaged! The main vat is leaking, and the emergency valves are stuck. He needs help fixing it *now* before the season’s first batch is ruined. During the frantic repair (skill challenge!), they can find clues: a tuft of fine calico fur caught on a broken lever, a single, vibrant blue jay feather in a shadowy corner, and a crude symbol of the Silver Rabbit carved near the sabotage point. Before they can process this, the faction representatives arrive, each offering "assistance" and sizing up the new players in town.

Let the games begin, Dungeon Master. May your players navigate the intrigues of the Deepwoods with equal parts cunning and chaos.
