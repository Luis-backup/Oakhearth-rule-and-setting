## What is the Deepwoods?
#Deepwoods
The Deepwoods is the name for the entire forested area of resources, clearings, and denizens. It’s like the name of a country, although the Deepwoods is more an area than a united nation. The denizens—an all- purpose word to refer to mice, rabbits, foxes, birds, and others—are the Deepwoods’s “peoples,” none human, all of them anthropomorphic animals. The Woodland comprises thick, deep forests with plenty of resources for an enterprising empire, divided only by clearings and by paths. 

A clearing is a big area that the denizens of the Deepwoods have previously cut from the forest’s grip, now one of the important spaces playing home to denizen life in the Deepwoods. All clearings are fairly built up, their contents ranging from large villages to small cities.

The paths were similarly cut down ages ago, clear tracks amid the forest that connect the clearings and enable trade and travel. They’re maintained by a combination of constant use and active effort, most of the time on the part of the leading factions of the Deepwoods who control and need those paths. Plenty of paths have been lost to time and the forest’s voracious regrowth.

Beyond the clearings and paths lies the forest, a dangerous, wild space. No good, self-respecting denizen will go into the forest unless they have to. Bandits, thieves, and miscreants will often take refuge there, striking out from the thick growth to attack merchants upon the paths. Plenty of dangerous creatures abide within the forest—from enormous and terrible bears to strange and hidden deer. And there is an abundance of purely natural threats in the forest—flash floods, lightning strikes, hidden caves, and more.

The forest contains another important feature of the Deepwoods: the ruins of old. Sometimes these ruins are just decades old, leftover broken structures from prior iterations of the Eyrie Dynasties. Sometimes the ruins are ancient and overgrown, hiding strange secrets from civilizations long forgotten. The ruins are always dangerous enough to turn away all but the bravest or most foolish of denizens...but still lucrative enough to keep drawing them in with the promise of lost treasures, ancient relics, and more that the vagabonds can sell back in the clearings.
