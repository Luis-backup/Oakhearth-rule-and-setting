## What is the Deepwoods?
#Deepwoods
The Deepwoods is the name for the entire forested area of resources, clearings, and denizens. It’s like the name of a country, although the Deepwoods is more an area than a united nation. The denizens—an all- purpose word to refer to mice, rabbits, foxes, birds, and others—are the Deepwoods’s “peoples,” none human, all of them anthropomorphic animals. The Deepwoods comprises thick, deep forests with plenty of resources for an enterprising empire, divided only by clearings and by paths. 

A clearing is a big area that the denizens of the Deepwoods have previously cut from the forest’s grip, now one of the important spaces playing home to denizen life in the Deepwoods. All clearings are fairly built up, their contents ranging from large villages to small cities.

The paths were similarly cut down ages ago, clear tracks amid the forest that connect the clearings and enable trade and travel. They’re maintained by a combination of constant use and active effort, most of the time on the part of the leading factions of the Deepwoods who control and need those paths. Plenty of paths have been lost to time and the forest’s voracious regrowth.

Beyond the clearings and paths lies the forest, a dangerous, wild space. No good, self-respecting denizen will go into the forest unless they have to. Bandits, thieves, and miscreants will often take refuge there, striking out from the thick growth to attack merchants upon the paths. Plenty of dangerous creatures abide within the forest—from enormous and terrible bears to strange and hidden deer. And there is an abundance of purely natural threats in the forest—flash floods, lightning strikes, hidden caves, and more.

The forest contains another important feature of the Deepwoods: the ruins of old. Sometimes these ruins are just decades old, leftover broken structures from prior iterations of the Eyrie Dynasties. Sometimes the ruins are ancient and overgrown, hiding strange secrets from civilizations long forgotten. The ruins are always dangerous enough to turn away all but the bravest or most foolish of denizens...but still lucrative enough to keep drawing them in with the promise of lost treasures, ancient relics, and more that the vagabonds can sell back in the clearings.

### History of the Deepwoods
The history of the Deepwoods...is unknown. At least, its depths remain buried beyond memory and record. Recent events have left a far greater impression, but the far-off history of the Deepwoods is out of reach. 

The Deepwoods itself is ancient, and denizens of myriad kinds have been carving out lives there for ages. Some denizens even tell stories today of ancient empires or cultures that once spread out where the trees now grow—all that is left of them are ruins grown over with roots and ivy. 

As far as most living there today are aware, the Deepwoods hasn’t been unified, or even connected, for all that long—not in the grand scheme of time. Those who did make lives there have crafted homes largely in isolation, periodically making contact with others perhaps to trade, but otherwise living alone or with only their families. For those in the Deepwoods, there were always tales of greater empires and cities in far-off lands, but those places weren’t here, and the world amid the leaves was untouched by their reach. 

Everything changed some time ago when the denizens began to work together, creating clearings within the Deepwoods where they could live together in safety. They cut back the forest and turned some trees into buildings. They tamed the growth until there was a boundary past which the Deepwoods could not encroach. They even blazed trails across the Deepwoods, between the different clearings, and wore them so thoroughly that they became known paths—the veins of a new Deepwoods.

This “new” Deepwoods—not exactly unified, but connected to itself; not safe, but livable—is the one that persists to this day. The denizens who live there are proud of the lives they make for themselves, lives characterized by the difficulty of surviving amid such wilds and the rewards of making their own lives, instead of being handed something by the powers that be. 

The forests between the clearings and the paths are still utterly wild, great hiding places for bandits and criminals, home to dangerous or unknowable creatures like bears or deer. The paths themselves are far from safe—plenty of dangerous denizens like to stage ambushes along the path, and all it takes is one bad storm to send a flood crashing across the path at the wrong moment. The Deepwoods is still a place of hardship and difficulty...but the denizens who call it home wouldn’t leave it for the world.
