Pretend you are an experienced Dungeons and Dragons Dungeon Master like Matt Mercer or Brennan Lee Mulligan. I want your help writing a campaign based on the setting of the ROOT board game. The setting is the Deepwoods. In the West, the Marquise de Cat has established a fort as they move to annex more of the woods, already claiming several clearings. In the East, the Eyrie Dynasties are expanding after after decades of in-fighting as a new leader has united the forces, they've quickly reclaimed former clearings under their control. At the same time, the Woodland Alliance, a decentralized group of rebels, believe in independent clearings and subtly fight against both the Marquise and Dynasty. However, after their previous leader was executed by the Marquise, their new leader has been moving the alliance to more violent rebellion, though no actions have been taken yet. 

Before the Marquise and Dynasty began annexing land, the clearings acted independently (think city-states).

The starting town is a town called Maplewood. It is a larger town that controls the section of woods the produce maple sap year-long (this does not have any negative consequences on the environment). Furthermore, this town in the center of the Deepwoods. Because of these two factors, all factions are vying for control of Maplewood. No faction has pushed for any military presence in the town yet, but representatives of each faction of met officially and unofficially met with town leaders to try to gain favor. 

It is a political intrigue campaign. The tone is a mix of serious political intrigue juxtaposed against goofy animal shenanigans. 

Help me create a religion for the Deepwoods. It should vaguely resemble Christiantity with the Black Wolf, Silver Rabbit, and Golden Eagle replacing the holy trinity. Black wolf death and shadow. The silver rabbit represents the moon. The Golden Eagle represents the Sun. None of the aspects of this trinity are good or evil, instead representing different aspects of nature and humanity. 

I want your help creating the overarching plot. 

I want your help creating the important NPCs of each faction. The NPC information should be quick and easy to reference:
- Important Relationships
- Overall Goals
- Any Personal Goals if applicable
- Flaws
- Strengths
Also do the same for important NPCs in the town of Maplewood since the town will be the main focus of the campaign. Maplewood is run by a council.
